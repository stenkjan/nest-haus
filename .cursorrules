# Project Rules for Nest-Haus Configurator

## Code Quality & Documentation
- Make sure to include the indexed documentations of the languages and tools we use when needed: React, Next.js, Prisma, Redis, PostgreSQL
- Always try to keep the codebase slim and the code you generate concise
- Don't change any content or design properties that are not directly related to a prompt, if unsure, always ask

## Development Workflow
- Check for existing running servers (localhost:3000) before running a new server, we have hot reload in place
- Fill out the documentation in /docs after every commit, use the predefined .md files and continue them
- Use GitHub actions to continuously document

## Architecture Constraints
- Backend tracking system (Redis + PostgreSQL) must remain intact
- Session management and analytics should not be disrupted
- Price calculations must use existing PriceCalculator logic
- State management should use the established store pattern (Zustand)

## Integration Guidelines
- New configurator components must integrate with useConfiguratorStore and useCartStore
- All user selections must be tracked via the session APIs
- Cart functionality should remain compatible across the app
- Maintain backward compatibility during migrations
